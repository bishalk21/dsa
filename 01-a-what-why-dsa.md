1. What is DSA?

- is tool that can help in logic perform or problem solving & optimization in time space complexity.
- fundamental is problem solving!

2. Why DSA?

- work in core/internal of library or framework
- build performant system
- build complex frontend problems and scale

3. Are you able to solve any problem? Is DSA required for frontend developers?

- stack algorithm: undo redo, browser history, function call stack (event queue), expression evaluation
- queue algorithm: task scheduling, buffering, priority queue in network tab, message queues
- search, filtering and sorting: binary and linear search, filtering a list of items
- DOM manipulation and traversal: Depth-Breadth Search (DFS)
- Tree Traversal Algorithm: pre-order, in-order, post-order, navigation menus, diffing algo in virtual dom
- graph algorithms: gui interactions, flowcharts, questionare, interactive maps, diagrammatic tools
- cache and memoization
- form validation logic
- data structures for real time updates

For JavaScript:

- Fundamentals

  - Array
  - Object
  - Map

- Stack
- Queue
- Priority Queue
- Linked List
- Tree
- Graph

4. Why DSA is so hard?

- FOMO: without dsa, no job
- asked in interviews
- FAANG DSA level is very high
- lack of visualization
- not able to work/relate in real projects

5. how to master DSA?

- start with real life problems
- do not jump into code, but whiteboard
- write algorithm in native
- visualization
- convert algorithm into code
- consistency
