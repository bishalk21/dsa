:zap: In Computer Science a _queue_ is an abstract _Data Structure_ where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

Write a function `nextInLine` which takes an array (`arr`) and a number (`item`) as arguments.

Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array.

The `nextInLine` function should then return the element that was removed.
