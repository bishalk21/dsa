`pop()` always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

That's where .shift() comes in. :zap: It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.

:fire:

Use the `.shift()` function to remove the first item from `myArray`, assigning the "shifted off" value to `removedFromMyArray`.
