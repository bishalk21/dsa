An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the `push()` function.

:zap: `.push()` takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.

```javascript
var arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4);
// arr is now [1,2,3,4]
```

:fire:

Push `["dog", 3]` onto the end of the`myArray` variable.
