Previously we have used the code

```javascript
var myName = "your name";
```

`"your name"` is called a _string literal_. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

:fire:

Create two new `string` variables: `myFirstName` and `myLastName` and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.
