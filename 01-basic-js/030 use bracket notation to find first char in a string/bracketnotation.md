_Bracket notation_ is a way to get a character at a specific _index_ within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as _Zero-based_ indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if `var firstName = "Charles"`, you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

Use _bracket notation_ to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to _firstLetterOfLastName_.

Hint
Try looking at the firstLetterOfFirstName variable declaration if you get stuck.
