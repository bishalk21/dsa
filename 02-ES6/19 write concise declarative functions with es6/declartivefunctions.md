When defining functions within objects in ES5, we have to use the keyword `function` as follows:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello: function() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};
```

:black_heart: With ES6, You can remove the function keyword and colon altogether when defining functions in objects. Here's an example of this syntax:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};
```

Refactor the function `setGear` inside the object `bicycle` to use the shorthand syntax described above.
