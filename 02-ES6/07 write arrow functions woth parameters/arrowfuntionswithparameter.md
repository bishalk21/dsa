Just like a normal function, you can pass arguments into arrow functions.

```javascript
// doubles input value and returns it
const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
You can pass more than one argument into arrow functions as well.
```

:fire:

Rewrite the `myConcat` function which appends contents of `arr2` to `arr1` so that the function uses arrow function syntax.
