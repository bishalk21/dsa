/** What is Stack and Queue in Code?
 * A stack and a queue are abstract data types that define specific ways to organize and manipulate collections of elements.
 * They provide a way to manage data based on specific access patterns.
 *
 * In Code:
 * - Stack:
 *   - Implemented using arrays or linked lists.
 *   - its restricted access nature means elements can only be added or removed from the top of the stack.
 *   - Common operations:
 *     - push(element): Add an element to the top of the stack.
 *     - pop(): Remove and return the top element of the stack.
 *     - peek(): View the top element without removing it.
 *     - isEmpty(): Check if the stack is empty.
 * - Queue:
 *   - Implemented using arrays or linked lists.
 *   - its restricted access nature means elements can only be added at the back and removed from the front of the queue.
 *   - Common operations:
 *     - enqueue(element): Add an element to the end of the queue.
 *     - dequeue(): Remove and return the front element of the queue.
 *     - front(): View the front element without removing it.
 *     - isEmpty(): Check if the queue is empty.
