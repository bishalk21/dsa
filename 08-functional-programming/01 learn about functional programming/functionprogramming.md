Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope.

_INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT_

Functional programming is about:

1. Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

2. Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

3. Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

The members of freeCodeCamp happen to love tea.

In the code editor, the `prepareTea` and `getTea` functions are already defined for you. Call the `getTea` function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the `tea4TeamFCC` variable.
